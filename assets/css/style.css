honestly couldn't get the hang of this. Going back and watching the class video and
going to take notes. Will sign up for tutor time on more help with this.
-It is better to have more general code higher up in you CSS
-The width of the wrapper is what changes with sizing
-You can add on another media size using another @media screen at another pixel size
-max width use the larger numbers first and min width use larger numbers last 
-Avoid mixing min width and max width 
-Use the line <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> in every piece of code 
-Auto the wrapper 
-You use things such as margin and padding to position boxes
-Wrapper padding works better than box margin
-Float none could also work to get things to sit on top of them
-Make use of Dev tools
-Viewport is the visable space you use to see a website
